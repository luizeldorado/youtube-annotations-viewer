## About

YouTube will soon be removing (if they haven't already) the annotations from the videos. This website aims to restore them, either by looking in the YouTube servers, or by you inputting your own XML annotations file.

## Features

* View videos on the page
* Show stuff on top of the video
* Get annotation data directly from YouTube
* Get annotation data via user inputted XML file

## Not implemented features but it would be really cool if someone made them

* Have a server where people can upload annotations for specific videos, so people can see them by just putting the link
* Make the annotations be below the GUI of YouTube, but still above the video itself
* Add the pointer thingy to the speech ballon type
* Select XML via file or URL instead of text
* Support more types of annotations. I'm not even sure what types even exist
* Make it look more pretty
* Figure out how does the font size work; it seems to automatically shrink depending on the size
* Ok, don't make it too pretty.

## Can I help?

Sure, if you find a video where the annotations don't appear or don't work correctly, please send me the link to said video and I'll try to figure it out. You can make a issue for that, which can also be used to report general bugs or problems in the website. You can also directly edit the code and make a pull request.
